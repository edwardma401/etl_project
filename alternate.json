        "summary_short": "After the galloping intelligence displayed in the first two parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series, your fear may be that Peter Jackson would become cautious and unimaginative with the last episode of his trilogy. But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His &quot;King&quot; is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment  follows the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy the sinister object.  The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, believes that Frodo is on a suicide mission: &quot;There never was much hope. Just a false hope.&quot; Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with its pounding and operatic martial fury — a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging —  can be found here. By its end, &quot;King&quot; glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the &quot;Ring&quot; movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: &quot;You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.&quot; It's an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale pop-action film. — Elvis Mitchell",

There are two groups probably sharing the same dread about this film adaptation of J. R. R.

        "summary_short": "Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion in this second of the film adaptations. It may be the first sequel that does not bother to give a reprise of the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is simply to drop us right into the action. This stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension, the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey. Their mission began in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, could begin the end of life on Middle Earth. The warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) has been inflated into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle. The action sequences are even more compelling than the first time around; we could be watching Orson Welles's &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; as directed by George A. Romero — Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. There are flaws, particularly the family-oriented video-game aspects, which offer no emotional complications other than saving the day. — Elvis Mitchell",

Keanu Reeves, perhaps worried that he was showing too much range, has purged himself of all expression apart from a worried frown and a sorrowful grimace, which is mirrored in the face of Carrie-Anne Moss, who returns as Trinity. The salient distinction of the human remnants in Zion, apart from their earth-toned natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom. It is not altogether worthless: the Wachowski Brothers still know how to stage an action sequence, and there are some scenes that have a quiet, mysterious beauty. If they would only let go of their grandiose theological pretensions, they might once again be interesting filmmakers. — A. O. Scott",

Adrien Brody, in a fluid, understated and thoroughly unsentimental performance, plays Wladislaw Szpilman, a popular concert pianist who survived, against odds that can only be described as absurd, the German occupation of Warsaw and the inferno of the city's Jewish ghetto. With relentless clarity, Mr. Polanski tracks the deterioration of his hero's situation and the day-in, day-out assault on his humanity. There are scenes of unwatchable brutality as well as of kindness and solidarity, but what is most remarkable is the sense of daily life in impossible conditions. The last part of the movie, in which Szpilman is first trapped in a safe house and then condemned to wander the bombed-out city, is a tour de force, at once harrowing and strangely comic. — A. O. Scott",

        "summary_short": "Michel Gondry's film, an angular and intelligent romantic comedy, isn't entirely consistent. Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for &quot;Human Nature,&quot; his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot;).  Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. — Elvis Mitchell",

On its own terms, though, the movie succeeds in dramatizing Mr. Nash's mental illness and, to a lesser extent, his mathematical insights. Russell Crowe's performance is honest and focused, but the movie's conceptions of intellectual life and human character are ultimately so simplistic, so deeply mistrustful of the audience's intelligence that any chance for genuine insight is squandered. – A.

The wittiest characters are Marlin's absent-minded traveling companion, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a cheery blue tang afflicted with short-term memory loss, and Bruce  (Barry Humphries), a scary Great White Shark who has adopted a 12-step program to curb  his insatiable appetite for other fish.

        "summary_short": "Quentin Tarantino's fourth movie, his first in six years, is astonishingly violent, intermittently fascinating and sometimes tedious. This may be the picture's most serious flaw, since it comes from a man whose worship of action movies from all over the world (but especially Asia) is evident in every frame. Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day. In this film, the first installment in a two-part revenge epic, the Bride wakes up from a 4-year coma and goes after the hired swords and guns who attacked her. Most of the exposition has been left for Volume Two; this one is an anthology of increasingly violent sequences, some sickening, some rather thrilling, that culminates in a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath  during which Lucy Liu, playing a petite yakuza boss, shows off her Japanese, and also (quite literally) her brains. — A.

Part comedy, part caper film, this picaresque tale gently satirizes the sillier side of the swinging 60's. It is also a cat-and-mouse game in which Frank tries to elude Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an earnest, fuddy-fuddy F.B.I. agent who finally catches up with him in France. Mr. DiCaprio, that chameleonic 28-year-old man child, is, in a word, sensational. — A. O. Scott\r\n",

In Monstropolis, the freakazoid parallel dimension in which the monsters live, children's screams are used as a power source. But any artifact from the human world is a contaminant, so when a 3-year-old girl enters Monstropolis, panic erupts and it's up to two monsters, Sully (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal), to return her without being blamed for the mishap. There hasn't been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;; this is one clean-burning engine that doesn't waste a joke or a thought. – Elvis Mitchell",

This time, it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jess must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine.   Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom   that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating   sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Richard Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama. — A.
