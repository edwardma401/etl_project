A recent — very recent — decision to have an American actor, Breckin Meyer, voice the lead instead of Mr. Benigni, who also stars as Pinocchio and was a co-writer of the screenplay, leaves you with the impression that Mr. Meyer was actually in the projection booth reading the script. That might account for the quality of the voice-overs, which are so sloppy you might feel as if you're watching a 1978 Hong Kong action picture: the dubbed mouths of the Italian cast are probably still moving an hour after the film is over. There must have been such a rush to get the prints into theaters for the nationwide opening that no one bothered to check the lip-synching. It's as if someone tried to hit a target with a can of paint. — Elvis Mitchell\r\n",

But Jack is also catnip for the kind of woman who fantasizes about taking a walk on the wild side. And in the shaky screen adaptation of a novel by Wang Shuo, Claire (Charlotte Ayanna), the woman who goes for that stroll against her better judgment, is a studious biology major at Columbia. If its early scenes have a bracing hard-boiled sting, the movie goes slack (and ultimately loses credibility) as it drifts into mushier territory and stumbles through three possible endings. — Stephen Holden",

The story follows three mounted policemen and an Aboriginal tracker on a mission to bring to justice a black man accused of murdering a white woman. The characters have symbolic names like the Tracker, the Fanatic, the Follower, the Veteran and the Fugitive. Gary Sweet's Fanatic is as scary a racist fiend as has ever been brought to the screen. David Gulpilil's Tracker, who is a bridge between the Aboriginal and white societies, exudes the same aura of mystical watchfulness and omniscience that he brought to the movies &quot;Walkabout,&quot; &quot;The Last Wave&quot; and &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence.'' The story is strung around a 10-song suite of narrative ballads, and  handsome mural-like illustrations by Peter Coad that deepen its mythical flavor. — Stephen Holden",

The elaborate story involves kidnappings, unsolved serial killings, second sight, church architecture, zodiac signs, Christian heresy, insomnia,  nightmares, potential medical malpractice, computer magic and the London police  department. This baggage proves way too heavy for the movie to make sense of. But the supernatural kidnapping drama can still be appreciated as an atmospherically volatile roller-coaster in which half-waking dreams increasingly erode reality. It all begins when Goran Visnjic, playing an anti-smoking hypnotherapist, is asked to unlock the traumas of a  catatonic little girl. — Stephen Holden",

That it is being released in 2001 says a lot about what the film promises, and what the film delivers. Matty (Matthew Modine) is a popular, pampered and prosperous movie star with the sort of substance abuse problems common to Mr. Ferrara's characters. The balance of the film is concerned with Matty's quest for forgiveness and redemption, a quest complicated by the fact that Matty has no clear idea of what he is atoning for. Like most of Mr. Ferrara's films, &quot;The Blackout&quot; takes place in a trance state — events are fuzzy, line readings even fuzzier. There are mysterious ellipses in the plotline and lots of droning electric guitar work on the soundtrack. — Dave Kehr",

His shenanigans, during which he addresses the audience in his trademark down-under idioms (&quot;crikey!,&quot; &quot;have a go at that!&quot;), are bundled into a  ludicrous, amusing story of international intrigue involving a spy   satellite, an ornery Queensland rancher and a pair of C.I.A. operatives whom  Mr. Irwin treats as another peculiar species of wildlife. Though Mr. Irwin's antic good spirits can be annoying (one occasionally envies the reptiles' inability to hear), they can also be very funny. Whether you're laughing at him or with him, you will find yourself laughing a lot. — A. O. Scott",

Set in working-class Irish Catholic Boston, this film revisits the themes of violence, honor and guilt that have haunted many of Mr. Eastwood's movies; it is among the most humane of his films, but also the most rigorously pessimistic. Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn play Dave, Sean and Jimmy, boyhood friends who must revisit the traumas of their youth when Jimmy's daughter is murdered. Sean and his partner (Laurence Fishburne) must investigate the killing, which it appears Dave may have committed. The performances are first rate. Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities. Mr. Penn's volcanic, furiously disciplined performance is surely one of the best pieces of screen acting you'll see this year; it may even be one of the finest ever. — A. O. Scott",

In answer, this intelligent, hectoring documentary offers an elaborate psychopathology of dishonest, unscrupulous and predatory behaviors, which are seen as expressions of the corporation's fundamental nature. Case studies in environmental pollution, aggressive branding, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of technology alternate with more general disquisitions on the brutal logic of global capitalism. The talking heads are mainly activists and scholars — Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, among others — with a few C.E.O.'s and orthodox economists thrown in for balance. While much of the material is persuasive, the film ensnares itself in contradictions it does not acknowledge, and paints a grim, tendentious picture of the modern world. Even Marx recognized the creative, liberating force of capitalism, and without some acknowledgement of the comforts, conveniences and pleasures that corporations provide, it is hard to understand their power or, for that matter, to oppose it effectively. — A.

        "summary_short": "With its microscopic eye for detail, Japanese anime is the ideal film medium for a techno-thriller like &quot;WXIII (Wasted 13: Patlabor the Movie 3),&quot; a visually absorbing futuristic fantasy that evokes a paranoid world choking on its own technology. With its murky chiaroscuro and fascination with machines (which it renders with far more precision than it does the faces of its characters) and brooding electronic score, the film, set in Tokyo in the near future, sustains a heady noirish atmosphere that might be called Technomood. A tangled modern police drama folded into an old-fashioned monster movie with echoes of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;King Kong,&quot; the film is the third cinematic spinoff from the successful &quot;Patlabor&quot; franchise. &#151; Stephen Holden\r\n",

Remember, kids can be very cruel &#151; and this latest get-Cuba-Gooding-Jr.-career-counseling-fast project is a misfire from beginning to end. Mr. Gooding plays Jerry, who's in mourning over the break up of his relationship with Felicia (Vivica A. Fox). The barking hound-dog Nick (Horatio Sanz) talks Jerry into joining him on a singles cruise, but the travel agent they anger gets his revenge by booking the pair on a gay singles cruise. &quot;Trip&quot; is a series of flashing semaphores that signal its dreariness. It has the most exhausted collection of song clichés this side of a Time-Life oldies collection, starting with James Brown's &quot;I Feel Good,&quot; and all the way to the eventual cover of &quot;I Will Survive.&quot; What's missing from this motley medley is a tune by Cuba Gooding Sr.: &quot;Everybody Plays the Fool.&quot; The junior Gooding has shown himself to be a game actor, and he's fearless at throwing his entire being in pictures that seem to exist to prove that he can be in something worse than the last thing you saw him in. If &quot;Trip&quot; were screened on a cruise ship, most of the passengers would be dog-paddling back to shore. &#151; Elvis Mitchell\r\n",

This two-hour-plus movie wants to be an Eastern European answer to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; and every now and then it lives up to that promise. The movie is fueled by Mr. Mashkov's  blazing portrayal of Platon, a brilliant, charming, schemer and prankster whose high-rolling way of life eventually closes in around him. The tone of the narrative, which confusingly darts around in time, suggests a jazzy, comically edged film noir. If the movie feels convincingly wired to the moment, it is finally too scatterbrained and anecdotal for the strands of its story to cohere into more than an intriguing jumble. — Stephen Holden",
